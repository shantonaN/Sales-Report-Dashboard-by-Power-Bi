📊 My First Power BI Dashboard

This repository contains my first ever Power BI Dashboard, created as part of my learning journey in Data Analytics. It’s a Sales Report Dashboard where I practiced hands-on with Power BI features such as slicers, charts, maps, and formatting.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to explore and visualize sales data in an interactive dashboard.
I followed tutorials and then applied my own design ideas to make the dashboard structured, colorful, and easy to interpret.

📌 Features

Dynamic Filters (Slicers): Year-based filtering for flexible analysis.

Category-wise Sales Analysis: Bar chart showing sales across categories.

Sales Trend by Month: Line chart to track sales performance over time.

Geographical Insights: Map visualization to show sales distribution by province.

KPI Display: A card visual showing the total sales quantity (9M).

Dashboard Design: Borders, colors, and layout adjustments for better readability.

✨ Learning Reflection

This is my first attempt at building a dashboard in Power BI.
I believe that only learning without hands-on practice is like trying to learn swimming without ever diving into the water. That’s why I pushed myself to try, even if it’s not perfect yet.

I’m looking forward to building more dashboards, experimenting with DAX measures, and improving my data storytelling skills.
